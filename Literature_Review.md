# Literature Review on AI in Personalized Education Systems

## Abstract

## Introduction

(Add research question)
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has adapted itself in different fields to transform conventional practices and education is not exempted. Of recent, AI has proved to be an innovation in higher learning institutions providing new approaches to improving learning. Application of AI in the specific field of educational ones is projected towards the use in the personalized education systems. These systems apply AI technologies to make educations and learning materials and opportunities for each learner individual specific. Personalized education as one of the instructional approaches tries to deviate from the traditional form of education where every individual is taught in the same way, such systems are said to contribute to improvement in academic performance, students' participation, satisfaction, and even educational experience.

However, the integration of AI into personalized education systems in higher learning institutions as it is apparent is still at its infancy. As institutions get involved with these technologies, it would then be significant to determine their impact, in a way that is credible and reliable. The purpose of this study is to understand the effect of AI-enabled learner centric platforms and interventions on major education process indicators, learning satisfaction, achievement, participation and experience. Moreover, it will discuss crucial, though often narrow down to the technical aspects, ethical factors such as fairness, data protection, and openness since the AI use in education must consider values across different domains.

## Purpose and Aim of the Literature Review

This literature review seeks to examine the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the process of personalisation of learning in higher education environments. The purpose is to find ways in how AI can be integrated to enhance students' satisfaction level as well as performance due to the right content that suits them. With the help of several studies, as well as several real-life examples, this review is going to explore what is already being done well, what are the key issues, and how it is possible to improve this further, in the context of AI systems.

At the same time it is important to take into account the ethical aspect of this matter, for instance, it is crucial to make sure that these systems do not have a bias, students are not violated in their right for privacy or the fact that they have the right to know why certain decision has been made by an AI. Such gaps will be underlined in this review and will also help to identify what area require more attention. It can be added that the goal is to contribute to the construction of a more effective and ethically appropriate model of personalized education in higher education with the help of AI.

## Literature Review Process

### Search Strategy
(IEEEXplore and Science Direct)
The literature search is to be performed using peer-reviewed databases to make collection of studies, articles, and reports. Based on the literature trends in education technology & AI, important databases like ACM DL, IEEE Xplore, Jstor, Google Scholar & ScienceDirect will be used as they cover a wider area of education technology & AI research. The following key words will also be used in searching for literature by typing them in the search bar: 'AI in education', 'Personalized learning in higher education', 'AI in education platforms', 'student engagement with AI'. Other filter features such as date of the publication and subject specific filters shall be employed so as to eliminate irrelevant and older studies.

### Inclusion Criteria
(spcific range of time, review articles)

Since the aim will be to keep the identified literature relevant and valid, specific inclusion criteria will be used. Research work published in the last five years will only be included in the current review to make sure that it is up to date with the existing and emerging topics in the respective area of research. The selection will be based on the subject focus and type of publication: only the journal articles from peer-reviewed journals, conference papers and industry reports that discuss AI implementation in personalised education systems, especially within the context of higher education will be considered. Particular attention will be paid to the papers which gives quantitative data, use case-based approach, and reviews which contain both theoretical and practical aspects. Moreover, to obtain a richer perspective on AI in education, Priority will be given to literature that examines the ethical issues, challenges, and effects of AI in education, to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the topic.

## Literature Review

### Introduction

Education is an area of the economy that has embraced technology in its operations and especially what is known as Artificial Intelligence (AI). This review seeks to examine how AI assists in the area of improving student learning, assistances to students with learning disabilities and how AI helps in the translation of materials in education. This is in endeavours to ensure that the different students’ needs are met, as well as the efficient delivery of the teaching process.

### Key Findings and Insights

According to Pesek et al. (2022) the use of AI also offers the advantages of adapting to the learner thus improving the level of motivation [1]. With regards to teachers, AI’s data analysis leads to the ability to tailor the instruction approach [2]; for students, the use of adaptive applications and learning environments developed by AI benefits learners with disabilities [3]. Further, it facilitates the translation of resources so that educations face minor language barriers and other workloads [4][5].

### Trends, Patterns, and Emerging Issues

Personalized learning through AI is another trend that is gaining momentum as it improves learning by making learning models unique and based on individual learning styles [6]. Nevertheless, AI implementation into current learning environments poses a significant problem. Some of the issues include: the maturity of the technology and the degree of readiness of the teachers [7].

### Gaps in the Research

The present research gaps include for instance, studies that aim at establishing effects of AI implementation on students, regardless of context [8]. There are other issues as well, such as ethical, for instance, data privacy and algorithms bias, which should be also examined in detail [9]. Such practices include AI integration and how the effectiveness of AI in has been achieved [10].

### Critical Analysis

Some strengths of the AI state of the art are that 1) It does offer some valuable insights About AI 2) It lacks a comparative analysis based on a long-term view that looks at the impact of AI beyond the current status quo 3) It does offer a section on the ethical consideration of AI but it is very short [11][12]. Focusing on particular cases offers only limited views of the broad context of education, and hence the need to address more complex and less ethical approaches to applications of artificial intelligence.

## Literature Review

### Introduction

AI which has been used as a tool in solving a variety of functions is now being used to deliver personalised learning to students in higher learning institutions. It is essential for this reason, to critique its efficiency with the purpose of fine-tuning educational practices.

### Summary and Synthesis

Wang and Yu (2023 [1]) describe the shift from particular AI applications to the complex systems intergrading with educational systems. Johnson et al. (2022) [2] show that technology increases learning outcomes and, therefore, students' interest; however, such platforms must be specialized for different learning styles. Smith and Lee (2021) [3] reveal that, although AI operates positively in promoting learning activities, it erodes teachers' agency. Brown and Patel (2023) [4] examine the ethical risks related to the use of AI and suggest that the main concerns to be solved are data privacy and algorithmic bias.

### Trends, Patterns, and Gaps

The literature presents throws light on recent trends towards learner centered instruction and single node artificial intelligence systems. However, significant gaps include:

- **Global Perspectives**: Many of the works in the field are geographically oriented so there are few data about the AI in different forms of education.

- **Long-Term Impact**: Unfortunately, little is as known about the positive or negative impacts of AI on academic achievement and student enrollment in institutions.

- **Equity Issues**: Lack of novelty in pointing out challenges of AI in enhancing or worsening learning inequalities.

### Critical Analysis

The studies provide significant information, however, there are some restrictions. Include sufficient and creativity in methods of data analysis and they lack longer term impact assessments, their regional specializations are also weak. Issues like ethical issues such as, data privacy/fairness are important and can't be overemphasized; there is still more research to be done on these.
